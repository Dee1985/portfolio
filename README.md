My Portfolio :  https://dee1985.github.io/portfolio/

It's been a challenging (but exciting start to a new chapter in my life). This porfolio is my first project and it won't be my last. 

It's been quite a rollercoaster and a tad of a throw back to my younger years in college- it's hard to not be on top anymore in my chosen career. But, there's always room to grow and there's no growth without struggle. I look forward to learning and utilizing more tools in addition to HTML and CSS throughout my learning adventure.
