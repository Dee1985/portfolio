         <p>Greetings!!
             
            It's a very exciting time for me right now. I'm making
            quite a career change. I've been a nurse for over a decade
            you see, so I've come to learn and appreciate just how unique
            and resiliant every life is. It's time for me to grow in 
            my profession as I step away from floor nursing and move towards a more tailored client 
            experience. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm originally from SE Asia, and my dream is to help brige the gap
            between Eastern and Western philosophies and practises towards health.
            I believe that there's a lot we can learn from one another. On that note,
            I love to travel and discover! Whether it's traveling the world with my
            husband or just walks with my puppers- I have a hard time sitting still.
            I also enjoy hopping on Steam when time allows, pinball, hiking, stainedglass and 
            so much more! I would love an opportunity to tell you more about be and hopefully
            learn about you as well. 
            
            Cheery Goodybye!
